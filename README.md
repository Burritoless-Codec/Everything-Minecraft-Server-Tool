## No longer maintained.
As I made this over 7 years ago I doubted it even worked but somehow it does. I have started working on an updated version in python. If you want to look into that go here [Burritoless-Codec/MCST](https://github.com/Burritoless-Codec/MCST)

## Everything Minecraft Server Tool
This appears to still work but I am sure there are better options out there now.

What it can do: EULA, Server.Properties

To download a server go here [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server)

## Visual Basic.net

Not sure the version but this is an old project.
